# CS-370-8-2-Portfolio-Submission

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:
What code were you given?**
The code provided included the game setup files: GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py. These files established the environment and the basic framework for the pirate intelligent agent.

**What code did you create yourself?**
I developed the reinforcement learning algorithm for the pirate intelligent agent. This involved creating the game loops and implementing the pathfinding solution using Keras and TensorFlow libraries to enable the agent to learn and navigate the maze effectively.

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze software and systems to solve complex problems. Their work is critical as it drives technological advancements and improves efficiencies across various industries, from healthcare to finance to entertainment.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
I approached this problem with a technical mindset, leveraging my understanding of reinforcement learning and neural networks. I systematically analyzed the problem, broke it down into manageable components, and iteratively developed and tested the solution to ensure optimal performance.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
Computer scientists have a duty to ensure their solutions are reliable, fair, and secure. This course has reinforced my understanding of ethical responsibilities, emphasizing the importance of transparency, data privacy, and the broader impact of deploying intelligent systems. Ensuring that the intelligent agent operates predictably and without bias is paramount to maintain trust and integrity in the solutions provided to both end users and organizations.
